The DriverPass project involved designing a web-based system for a client who wanted to improve driver training and lesson scheduling. The client, DriverPass, led by owner Liam and IT officer Ian, needed a platform to offer online classes, manage lesson appointments, track progress, and ensure secure, role-based access for employees.

I did well in clearly identifying the client’s requirements and translating them into detailed functional specifications and user roles. If I were to revise one part, I would improve the system’s handling of offline data access and synchronization, making it more robust and better defined to prevent data conflicts.

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing their goals—like flexible scheduling, secure access, and DMV integration—and reflected these in system components such as user management, appointment booking, and automatic updates. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the system is practical, user-friendly, and meets real-world requirements.

My approach to software design involves gathering detailed requirements, creating clear use cases, and defining system architecture with scalability and security in mind. In the future, I would emphasize iterative prototyping and continuous user feedback to refine designs and ensure alignment with evolving user needs.
